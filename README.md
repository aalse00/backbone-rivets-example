### Backbone.js + Rivets.js = Crazy Delicious

It seems that data binding is all the rage these days with modern web development stacks. Angular, Ember, Knockout and more have data binding built in at the core. 

Backbone.js tends to be less opinionated about how a view should render (or bind) and therefore doesn't have any binding built in. Personally I think that's a good thing. However there are cases where binding can save you a fair amount of pain and can yield more intuitive, re-usable cose.

In this repository you'll find a tutorial & pratical example of how you can use [Rivets.js](http://rivetsjs.com) (created by [Michael Richards](https://github.com/mikeric) to implement powerful binding patterns in your Backbone views with minimal effort.

* Here's an example demonstrating using Backbone.js and Rivets.js together: http://wmdmark.github.io/backbone-rivets-example/

* The code for the example is located in this repo here (CoffeeScript): https://github.com/wmdmark/backbone-rivets-example/blob/master/app/example.coffee

* A tutorial describing the implementations details of this example can be found here: https://github.com/wmdmark/backbone-rivets-example/blob/master/tutorial.md

I hope you find this example/tutorial helpful. Please let me know if you have any feedback/suggestions for improving the tutorial or example code. I can be found here on Github or [@wmdmark](http://twitter.com/wmdmark) on Twitter.
